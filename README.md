# ClackChat
ClackChat is a keyboard hobbiest hub with a goal of bring people together to share their experiences and expertise. As a newcomer to the mechanical keyboard community, I found that finding information in one place was very difficult, and this app is an effort to bring mulitple resources to one consolidated site. Included on the site are videos on how to, product reviews, sound tests, typing games, and commentaries related to the hobby. Users can log in, and use the chat room to ask questions and see other people's keyboards, and find valuble resources for the own upcoming projects.
